# Transitive vs Bridged Treatment Comparisons

## Paul Zivich

The following repository presents a simulation study comparing transitive versus bridged treatment comparisons 
to compare different arms across two trials. In particular, the simulation demonstrates the danger of effect 
heterogeneity when comparing across different trials and how bridged treatment comparisons offer a way to 
analytically adjust for these differences in a simplified setting.

The transitive and bridging estimators are provided in the `estimators.py` file. Data generation, simulations,
and simulation results are presented in `simulation.ipynb`. This notebook should render in GitHub automatically.
